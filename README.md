# Machine Learning Projects Compilation

Created various Machine Learning and Deep Learning projects.

### Titanic

Created a Neural Network with 1 accuracy over titanic dataset along with proper data cleaning and pre-processing along with little feature engineering.

### Custom KNN

Implemented KNN algorithm from scratch and used it over iris dataset. Tried 3NN, 5NN, 7NN methods calculating accuracy of each and finding the most suitable hyperparameter for best predictions.

### Mobile Price Prediction

Created a regression model to calculate mobile phone price based on mobile phone features. Used dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rkiattisak/mobile-phone-price). Performed feature engineering and rigorous data cleaning to properly use all available data.
